# Complex Number

Complex numbers are type of a number system consists of `real` and `imaginary` part. Imaginary parts are denoted by `i` represents the value sqaure root of -1. Complex numbers are mathemeatically denoted as `a + bi` where `a` is the real part and `b` is imaginary. `utilict` can perform basic number operations on the complex numbers.

**Initialization**

```js copy
const complex = new ComplexNumber(2, 3); // This will form a complex number (2 + 3i), 2 is the real and 3 is imaginary.
```

**Methods**

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `getReal()` and `setReal(number)` | Gets the real value and sets the real value to the complex number. |
| `getImag()` and `setImag(number)` | Gets the imaginary value and sets the imaginary value to the complex number. |
| `add(anotherComplexNumber)` | Adds the another complex number to this one and set the real and imaginary part to this |
| `subtract(anotherComplexNumber)` | Subtracts the another complex number from this one and set the real and imaginary part to this |
| `multiply(anotherComplexNumber)` | Multiplies the another complex number to this one and set the real and imaginary part to this |
| `divide(anotherComplexNumber)` | Divides the another complex number to this one and set the real and imaginary part to this |

**Usage**

```js copy
const complex = new ComplexNumber(2, 3); // Creates a complex number 2 + 3i.
complex.add(new ComplexNumber(1, 7)); // Adds a new complex number 1 + 7i to the 2 + 3i, complex will be 3 + 10i.
complex.getReal(); // 3
complex.getImag(); // 10
complex.subtract(5, 6); // Subtracts a new complex number 5 + 6i from the 3 + 10i, complex will be -2 + 4i.

const complex2 = new ComplexNumber(3, 2); // Creates a complex number 3 + 2i.
complex2.multiply(new ComplexNumber(1, 7)); // Multiplies 1 + 7i to 3 + 2i, complex2 will be -11 + 23i.

const complex3 = new ComplexNumber(1, 1); // Creates a complex number 1 + 1i.
complex3.multiply(new ComplexNumber(1, 1)); // Multiplies 1 + 1i to 1 + 1i itself, complex3 will be 0 + 2i.

const complex4 = new ComplexNumber(2, 3); // Creates a complex number 2 + 3i.
complex4.divide(new ComplexNumber(4, -5)); // Divides 4 - 5i to 2 + 3i, complex4 will be -0.17073 + 0.53659i.
